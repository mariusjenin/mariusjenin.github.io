    "<b>Photonear</b> was realized during my second year of my Master's degree.",
    "It is a render engine that uses the Photon Mapping technology (see <a href=\"http://graphics.ucsd.edu/~henrik\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Henrik Wann Jensen Researchs</b></a>).",
    "My renderer includes a full User Interface and a scene visualization editor to get the best renders.",
    "With photon mapping, we can render scenes in global illumination with caustics (which is often a problem in realistic rendering)."
