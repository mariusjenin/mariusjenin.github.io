    "<b>The Metadjioo Display Stand</b> was realized during my intership in <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/metadjioo/about/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Metadjioo</b></a>.",
    "The objective was to create an interactive display stand. A visitor can watch quality videos filmed by the Metadjioo team about the wines displayed in front of him. He can also consult the technical data sheets of these bottles.",
    "The application provides this interaction by managing both the Android touch screen and a curved presentation screen. It will also allow the stand manager to choose which wine to present, with which videos and in which languages.",
    "Flexible screens attached to bottles also had to be managed to present videos to future customers in an innovative way."
