  "description": [
    "<b>Vroum</b> was realized during my third year of Computer Science degree where I was the project leader of a dozen of students",
    "The objective was to create a carpooling platform. Drivers could accept carpoolers in their vehicles in exchange for a financial contribution. These drivers can create trips on the site and carpoolers can search for and apply for them.",
    "The site has a built-in notification system to avoid missing trips and it also has a friends list system to arrange private trips."
