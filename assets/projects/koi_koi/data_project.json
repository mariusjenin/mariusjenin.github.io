    "<b>Koi Koi</b> was realized during my first year of Master's degree.",
    "This game is inspired by the real traditional Japanese game <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koi-Koi\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Koi Koi</b></a> played with Japanese Hanafuda cards. The theme of these cards is the seasons and flowers (Hanafuda literally means \"Flower Game\").",
